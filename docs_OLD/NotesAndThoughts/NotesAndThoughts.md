# Education

## My view on the purpose of education

- the purpose of education: refine our thoughts and make them more precise through knowledge and practice
- an educated person leverages knowledge and clear thought to make more and more precise (and accurate) statements about their respective field
- what differs among disciplines is the preferred language used to describe things in that field
- philosophy is about as precise as it gets without delving into mathematics
- [warnick thoughts on input-output and mechanistic models across STEM disciplines, maybe don't go too much into it here]

# Mathematics

## Language is one of the reasons why I am attracted to Robotics

- robotics are "completely" describable by mathematics, unlike something like biology in this current state
- [implications of this--why not put my efforts to discovering mathematical relationships in biology?]
- not to say that mathematical precision is more valuable than with natural language--natural language usually more influential because it is often more persuasive, for it is more easily relatable to lived experience

"Scrum is a proven and widely adopted method for achieving software agility. By working in short sprints, this iterative cycle can be repeated until enough work items have been completed, the budget is depleted or a deadline arrives. Project impetus is maintained, and when the project ends Scrum ensures that the most valuable work has been completed.

This contrasts sharply to the more traditional waterfall style approach that fixes the project scope upfront, requiring the extensive creation of requirements, analysis and design documentation before development can get started. Delays and budget overruns are common, and the failure to prioritize the feature set often results in low quality products that are overloaded with features that the customer/user does not actually require."
